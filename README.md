# Estee Lauder Code Test

Converts a CSV file into a GeoJson file, mobileFood.json.  The GeoJson file is loaded into a custom google map that is
used to mark the food truck locations.


STEPS TO GENERATE THE MAPS DATA:

To convert the csv file to a json file, NodeJS is required.  Run `node convertInputData.js`.
This NodeJS javascript calls readCSV.js, which reads in the csv file under _projectDir/resources and converts it into a
GeoJson file, mobileFoods.json, that is  written to the source directory.


STEPS TO VIEW THE CUSTOM MAP

The GeoJson data is loaded into a custom map using the Google Maps API.
To use Google Maps, a valid API_Key is required.

To view the map, download the project and open the src/index.html in a browser.

When the markers are clicked, a window displays the Applicant name, Location Description,
shows an icon that represents the FacilityType and the FoodItems.
